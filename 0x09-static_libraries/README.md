*README BEGINS*

* Static libraries are a set of regular object files, usually prefixed with the letter "a".
* The benefit of using a static library is that the functions and other symbols loaded into it are indexed
* Static libraries, while reusable in multiple programs, are locked into a program at compile time. Dynamic, or shared libraries, on the other hand, exist as separate files outside of the executable file.
